# Function to get map_type depending on map. It's stored in Settings(ingame) or lobby
#map type range :
# 0 : None (Shouldn't exist, but just in case there a problem)
# 1 : Altar
# 2 : Deathmatch (shouldn't this be also an option?)
# 3 : CTF

#The all random type is removed, to be an option in game settings instead

# In-game
