Setup of the game is divided in two phases:
- Lobby phase - all settings are saved in scoreboard named lobby
- InGame phase - all settings are stored in scoreboard named settings

Process of game setup include:
- (Lobby Phase) Setting Score var in GameStart vessel - it is maximum amount of points you need to gather
- (Lobby Phase) Setting Map var in GameStart ves. - number of map to be played???
- (Lobby Phase, end of) Initiation of Stats for all player and teleport to 198.60 35.00 -130.52
- (Ingame phase) Initiate_game and game_start. Those function manage with most systems' setups, and copy values from lobby to settings.

variable name and effect :
- max_loading - number of ticks it takes for a player to respawn
- tmp_respawn_time_left - number of seconds (calculated from max_loading) for a player to respawn
- game_state - (added by me) : Show the "current state" of the game :
    - 1 : Player has been teleported in the selection room the settings has not been initialized
    - 2 : settings has been initialized, we initiliaze the battleground the bossbar, and the player is being tp-ed in the selection room
    - 3 : We check if the team_select mode is on/off, if True, we tp the player to the team select zone (and wait for everyone to have choosen), if False, we skip to 4
    - 4 : We tp the player to the char selection zone
    - 5 : The player can choose their chars, we only switch to game_state 5 if there is NO player not having "in_a_team" tag and having "in_game"
    - 6 : The player spawn after a 3s wait
    - 7 : The game has been fully initialized, now we "wait" for a winner
    - 8 : We got a winner, we reset
Important coordinates : 

288.5 29.00 -107.5 --- Team select waiting room (or some sort?) 

287 15.00 -126 --- waiting room coordinates

Important !
I edited how "leaver" are considered : 
Now, when someones quit during game start, they are able to rejoin ONLY if the game has not be started, if it is, they are now considered as an "outsider"

Here is how i understand how is showed score : 
There is two scoreboard : ScoreDisplay and Score
Score is set to max value from the start of the game, and decrease to zero (i guess if its equal to 0 its win ?)
ScoreDisplay on other hand is on reverse
