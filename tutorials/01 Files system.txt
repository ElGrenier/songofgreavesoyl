Why hello there, in first "tutorial" for this map.
Wonder how many ppl will read this, anyway, its mainly for my own usage.

So, about files system: main datapack is pierogi. Inside:
- altars - namespace for functions dealing with altars EXCEPT the ones that manage score points
- battlegrounds - setup maps/arenas that you play on. Note that names inside dont really match in-game ones
- buffs - not used, but almost finished buffs system
- chars - namespace dealing with characters. Mainly item setup and functions helping with skills
- lobby - namespace for game setup: choosing arena, score, picking characters
- main - that one is quite screwed up, cuz there are functions:
     game_start, game_end, stats
     lossing teams
     (re)spawn on the map
     initiating stats (scoreboards)
     and some more, so yeah, it is MAIN
- others - for now, only deathmessages management
- profile - functions managing with profile, like achievement management or global stats
- score - counting and displaying score points
- weapuns - (very) simple system giving ppl their weapon back, if they accidently throw it away. Might be replaced one day
