Why hello there, in first "tutorial" for this map.
Wonder how many ppl will read this, anyway, its mainly for my own usage.

So, about files system: main datapack is pierogi. Inside:
- altars - namespace for functions dealing with altars EXCEPT the ones that manage score points
- battlegrounds - setup maps/arenas that you play on. Note that names inside dont really match in-game ones
- buffs - not used, but almost finished buffs system
- chars - namespace dealing with characters. Mainly item setup and functions helping with skills
- lobby - namespace for game setup: choosing arena, score, picking characters
- main - that one is quite screwed up, cuz there are functions:
     game_start, game_end, stats
     lossing teams
     (re)spawn on the map
     initiating stats (scoreboards)
     and some more, so yeah, it is MAIN
- others - for now, only deathmessages management
- profile - functions managing with profile, like achievement management or global stats
- score - counting and displaying score points
- weapuns - (very) simple system giving ppl their weapon back, if they accidently throw it away. Might be replaced one day



Hi ! Grenier here, i edited quite a lot the current way things are managed so here the "new" file system : 
- altars - namespace for functions dealing with altars AND (need to add it) the ones that manage (add) score points
- battlegrounds - setup maps/arenas that you play on. (Note that names inside dont really match in-game ones) (i'll edit them to match the names)
- buffs - not used, but almost finished buffs system (did not edited it, could try, but not for now)
- chars - namespace dealing with characters. Chars spells function and everything relating core chars function
- core - So its a new one, that fuse theses old namespace :
     - lobby
     - main
     - score
     - scoredisplay_api
     - ctf
     - maybe other things (will see)
     it is seperated in multiple folder : 
          - main - The main function of the map, it is still sorted out in different subfolder (i.e "random" which contain all randomization related function)
          - lobby - All the lobby part map
          - score - All the score system, WITH scoredisplay_api fused in it


What i plan to change in term of code sort : 

Move the summon command of important point (like summonning respawn point, flag point) in its own folder (so its findable easily)
